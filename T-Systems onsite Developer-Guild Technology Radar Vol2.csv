Team cognitive load;Adopt;Techniques;FALSE;"<p>Team interaction is a key concept when redesigning an organization for business agility and speed. These interactions will be reflected in the software being built (see <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us/news/2021/latest-thoughtworks-technology-radar-proclaims---embrace-conway-"">Conway's Law</a>) and indicate how effectively teams can autonomously deliver value to their customers. Our advice is to be intentional about how teams are designed and how they interact. Because we believe that organizational design and team interactions evolve over time, we think it's particularly important to measure and keep track of the <strong>team cognitive load</strong>, which indicates how easy or difficult teams find building, testing and maintaining their services. We've been using a <a href=""https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Team-Cognitive-Load-Assessment"">template</a> to assess team cognitive load that is based on ideas by the authors of the <em><a href=""https://teamtopologies.com/book"">Team Topologies</a></em> book.</p>
Cypress Component Testing;Assess;languages-and-frameworks;TRUE;"<p><a href=""https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/writing-your-first-component-test""><strong>Cypress Component Testing</strong></a> provides a testable component workbench to quickly build and test UI components. You can write component visual regression tests with the same API that you write end-to-end (E2E) UI tests. Although still in beta, component testing will be the most important feature in <a href=""/radar/tools/cypress"">Cypress</a> 10.</p>"
